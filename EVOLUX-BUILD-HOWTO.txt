howto build:

checkout git by:
– git clone git://gitorious.org/evolux-spark-sh4/evolux-spark-sh4.git

    cd /evolux-spark-sh4/tdt/cvs/cdk

    ./setuptdt.sh
    (that will install all needed packages, take care for newer linux-distris like ubuntu12.04 you must downgrade gcc to 4.5.3, script will ask you to do that)

    ./make.sh
    select if you want to build for “gm990(spark)” or “gmTriplex(spark7162)” , y/N
    select “with debug” or not, y/N (with debug only on spark)
    select stm, 209 or 210 or 211, y/N (stm24-210 recommended)
    select filesystem, jffs2 or yaffs2, (yaffs2 only for spark!), y/n
    do “make yaud…” or do “make evo…” showing aboth
    (if 1st checkout you must select for “evo” the “full” version, later the normal option is enough. the yaud-versions build only your selected gui, the evolux-versions build the flash evo-complete)

own_build folder:
– you must place your own “audio.elf + video.elf” to"/cvs/cdk/own_build/your_gui/boot" otherway it won’t boot!
– for non-fta you must also place your own “pti.ko” to “/cvs/cdk/own_build/your_gui/lib/modules”

notes:
git update with:
– git pull

    you can’t mix build for yaffs2 and jffs2 or stm24-209/210.
    if you want to change filesystem or kernel-version you have to do:
    make clean
    rm .deps/star-kernel-star (wiki dont allow showing “stars” so we wrote them out)
    ./make.sh

update nhd2-exp folder:
– make neutrino-hd2-update

recommended linux dsitris for build:
– ubuntu11.04 (32+64bit)
– ubuntu12.04 (32+64bit with gcc downgrade to 4.5.3)
