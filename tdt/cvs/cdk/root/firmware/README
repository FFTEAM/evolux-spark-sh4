The FDMA firmware files are required for stlinux24 kernels. The firmware can be linked
into the kernel (see CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE) or loaded by udev on request (hotplug did
not work). The symbolic links correspond to the file names requested by the kernel.

The FDMA firmware files have been extracted from the attachment published in the STM
bugzilla system (https://bugzilla.stlinux.com/show_bug.cgi?id=10686).
