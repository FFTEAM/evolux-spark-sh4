turn ac off
we will boot orig spark >=1.2.09 now for flashing:
- connect usb-stick with folder "enigma2" to pingulux
  (in folder "enigma2" must be "uImage + e2yaffs2.img, fw_env.config, fw_setenv + fw_printenv and flash_E2_yaffs2.sh")
- turn ac on and hold ok-button
- ass "force" displayed press "arrow-up"-button
- press "ok"-button
(arrow+ok button on pinglux-box NOT on RC!)
now orig spark should boot...
(sometimes orig goes directly to deepstandby than press on RC "power-on" again and it will boot)
as orig-spark has boot, do:
################################
telnet pingulux-ip
user: root
pw:root

/storage/c/flash_E2_yaffs2.sh

select option 1) YAFFS2

################################
that takes around 1 minute
till finished shutdown orig-spark now
turn ac off
hold ok-button and ac on again
as "force" displayed:
arrow-down
ok

now your flash-img should bootup as fast as hell(yaffs2) (neutrino around 13seconds, e2 around 45s)

if you want flash "normal" jffs2-img again, you must boot orig again and one more time /storage/c/flash_E2_yaffs2.sh but than select option "2".

if it's set back to jffs2 you can allways flash by usb-stick jffs2-images as before.

yaffs2-images can't be flashed ONLY from booted orig-spark and flash_E2_yaffs2.sh!!!
